_Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Used_

Encapsulation:
Data is protected using private attributes and accessed via public methods.
Abstraction:
User-friendly interfaces hide complex logic.
Inheritance:
Base classes are extended for better code reusability.
Polymorphism:
Overloaded and overridden methods enhance flexibility.
